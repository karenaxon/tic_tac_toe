# tic_tac_toe

This program mimics a Tic Tac Toe two player game. The user selects the
size of the game board and the players take turns placing a marker (X and
O) in empty cells of the game board. The first player to fill a row, column
or diagonal with his/her markers wins. The user can play as many times as
wished.
